### Example Usage:

  We exemplify the Complete HGT case, using Ecological Habitats.
  The Input files are extracted from the transfer database using proc-hom-v.0.2.R.
  
  Please note that decomposition of transfers was already performed in a previous database step.
  See section 4.3.3. Computation of HGT statistics, and Figure 1 for decomposition details.
  
  la_transfers.csv contains these fragments having the following structure:
  GN: gene,
  ALS: allele source,
  ALD: allele destination,
  WEIGHT: fragment weight,
  FRAGM_ID: fragment id,
  GENE_ID: gene id,
  SOURCE_ID: source id (ncbi gi),
  DEST_ID: destination id (ncbi gi)
  
  
  Then they are loaded into an numpy array or a scipy sparse matrix.
  
  See APPENDIX B for all clustering details including aggregation and weighting details.
  
  The final value is the one from Table 4.1a. Mean HGT rates Complete HGT 75% bootstrap, ubiquitous genes.
  
  Matrices could be easily exported to csv if need be.
  Example code is commented for this purpose.
