### proc-hom-ex


This Java application, is a multithreaded, dynamic task scheduler supporting managed execution.
For successive instances of TreePL, it detects crashes, changes parameters, and rerun using different constraints.

- [lib/tasks/hgt_tot.rake](lib/tasks/hgt_tot.rake) Complete and Partial HGT Detection
- [lib/tasks/hgt_clus.rake](lib/tasks/hgt_clus.rake) Running synthetic results, like those combining Complete and Partial HGT
- [lib/tasks/hgt_clus_par.rake](lib/tasks/hgt_clus_par.rake) Manages communication with the Cluster results.

Associated JRuby classes are in [lib/](lib/).

It uses an HSQLDB database, that it populates using Active Record migrations, located in [db/migrate](db/migrate).

Simulations are run on a remote Compute Canada cluster, then results are recuperated and inserted into the database.
Following aggregation final statistics are exported from the database and graphics are drawn.
