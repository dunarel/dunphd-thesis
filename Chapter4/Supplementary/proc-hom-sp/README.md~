### proc-hom-sp

This JavaCL Java application is using the OpenCL heterogeneous parallelizing framework to accelerate execution on NVIDIA graphic card.
It is at the same time an HSQLDB Java Stored Procedure using JDBC driver for better database performance.

It recovers Partial Horizontal Gene Transfers from their components scattered over multiply superposing windows, 
based on Graph connected components using Jaccard similarity. 

- [src/Connected1ComponentsKernels.cl](src/Connected1ComponentsKernels.cl) OpenCL kernel calculating the Jaccard distance one float at a time.
- [src/Connected4ComponentsKernels.cl](src/Connected4ComponentsKernels.cl) Lower bandwidth usage with float4 vectors.

- [src/org/uqam/doct/HgtParConnCompBest.java](src/org/uqam/doct/HgtParConnCompBest.java) Calculates Jaccard distance using new method based on median
- [src/org/uqam/doct/HgtParConnCompMed.java](src/org/uqam/doct/HgtParConnCompMed.java) Old method based on mean

These libraries are called from [../proc_hom/lib/tasks/hgt_par.rake](../proc_hom/lib/tasks/hgt_par.rake) to assemble continuous fragments.
