### q_func_jruby_ba


This Ruby NetBeans IDE project is a wrapper over the previous [q_func_java_ba](../q_func_java_ba) project.
I also extracts the Neisseria frpB periplasmic loops positions and draws them using gnuplot.

It is included here for reference, as some of the results will be wrapped and expanded in later projects.
