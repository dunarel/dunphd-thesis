### q_func_jruby_ba


This Ruby NetBeans IDE project is a wrapper over the previous [q_func_java_ba](../q_func_java_ba) project.
I also extracts the _Neisseria_ _frpB_ periplasmic loops positions and draws them using gnuplot.

It is included here for reference, as some of the results will be wrapped and expanded in later projects.
