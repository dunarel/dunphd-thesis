It consists of Ruby scripts running in a master/slave configuration.

The controling script running on the master node is admin/spadb.rb.

The simulation is also using simul_ruby/create_tree/createTree for random tree generation:

Journal of Computational Biology. January 2004, 11(1): 195-212. doi:10.1089/106652704773416966. 
implemented by Alix Boc - June 2008.

To simulate mutated sequences along branches of the tree we used:
Seqgen
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seqgen/


The main program is: 
simul_two_subtrees.rb

The binary Linux executable used is simul_ruby/bin/q_funcb.


The simul_ruby/lib folder contains the Ruby scripts used for the simulations.

These were inserted into an Apache Derby database.
See http://db.apache.org/derby/. 

Active Record migration scripts are provided to recreate the database structures supporting the simulations.
They are found in the [migrate](migrate) folder.
